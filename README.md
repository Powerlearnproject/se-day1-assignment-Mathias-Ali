Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is a systematic approach to design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software applications using engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build high quality software solutions
Software engineering plays an important part in technology industry by facilitating the creation of software application and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and health care


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milsestones in the evolution software engineering include
1. Development of Programming Languages(Python, Java, Fortran)
2. Establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline in the 1960s:
3. The advent of Structured Engineering in the 1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i. Requirements
ii. Design
iii. Implementation
iv. Testing
v. Deployment
vi. Maintenance

1. Requirements: Involves Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Involves creating high - level and detailed designs of the softwares architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests such as unit, integration, system and acceptance testing to ensure the software meets quality standard and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Involves releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software  after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall
While Agile methodologies is an iterative and increamental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer:Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environment (IDEs): They are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code (e.g Code block, Eclipse, visual studio)
Version Control Systems(VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g Git, Subversion)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges
1. Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
2. Tight deadlines: Pressure to deliver software product on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3. Technical dept:Accrued from shortcuts or suboptional solutions, it can impede future development efforts and increased maintenance cost.
Solutions
1. Effective communication
2. Agile methodologies for flexibility
3. Prioritization of task and regular reassesment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of a software
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance Testing:Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
Testing is very important to Quality assurance as it helps to identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher software product.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promp Engineering is the act of crafting questions or statements  to get the best possible responses from AI models
Prompt engineering decreases the chances of passing vague questions to an AI model, making the question clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
1. How do I navigate throuh an operating system file system?
2. How do I navigate through a Linux file system?
The first prompt will give a general overview of how any operating system file system works while the second prompt will specically guide me throung the Linux file system.
